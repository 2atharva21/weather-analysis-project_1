# Weather Analysis Project

This project is a comprehensive weather analysis and prediction application. The goal is to process, clean, analyze, and predict weather data using machine learning models. The dataset contains weather data with various features such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and timestamp information for different cities. Machine learning models like XGBoost and Random Forest are used to predict the temperature based on these features.

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze weather data and predict the temperature for various cities using machine learning models. It involves the following steps:

- **Data Collection**: The project utilizes weather data that includes parameters like temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and other factors that influence the weather. The data is stored in a CSV file (`weather_data.csv`).
  
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Missing values and infinite values are handled, and useful features like date and time information are extracted to improve the model's performance.
  
- **Visualization**: Key statistics and visualizations like histograms and KDE plots are generated to explore the data and understand its distribution.
  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Two machine learning models, **XGBoost** and **Random Forest**, are trained to predict temperature based on the weather features.
  
- **Model Saving**: The trained models are saved for future predictions, preventing the need to retrain them.

## Features

### Weather Data Analysis

- **Missing Data Handling**: The project identifies and handles missing values appropriately, either by removing rows with missing data or filling them with statistical measures (like the mean).
  
- **Outlier Detection**: Infinite or very large values are identified and removed to prevent them from affecting model performance.
  
- **City-wise Analysis**: The dataset is analyzed at the city level to explore temperature and humidity statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and range.
  
### Data Visualization

- **Histograms**: Histograms are used to visualize the distribution of temperature, humidity, and other numerical features.
  
- **KDE Plots**: Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots are used to visualize the distribution of temperature and humidity in a smoothed format.
  
- **Temperature vs Humidity**: A relationship between temperature and humidity is visualized to better understand their correlation.

### Machine Learning Models

- **XGBoost**: An efficient and scalable gradient boosting model used for regression tasks. It is trained to predict temperature based on weather features.
  
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method using multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting. It is also used to predict temperature.
  
- **Feature Scaling**: MinMax scaling is applied to normalize features such as humidity, pressure, and wind speed to improve the models' performance.

### Model Saving

- **XGBoost Model**: The trained XGBoost model is saved in `.json` format to allow for easy reloading and future use.
  
- **Random Forest Model**: The trained Random Forest model is saved as a `.pkl` file, which can be loaded for predictions.

### Git Large File Storage (LFS)

- **Handling Large Files**: Due to the large file size of model weights (especially for XGBoost), Git LFS is used to store and track these large files, ensuring they are managed properly within the Git repository.

## Requirements

### Python Libraries

The following libraries are required to run the project:

- `pandas` - Data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy` - Numerical operations and handling arrays.
- `xgboost` - Gradient boosting model for regression.
- `scikit-learn` - Machine learning library for training models and preprocessing.
- `joblib` - Used for serializing and saving models.
- `matplotlib` - Data visualization.
- `seaborn` - Enhanced data visualization for statistical graphics.

Install all the dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Git Large File Storage (LFS)

Git LFS is used to handle large files exceeding GitHub’s 100MB limit.

To install Git LFS, run:

git lfs install

Additional Setup for Windows Users

data/weather_data.csv: Contains the weather dataset with columns such as timestamp, city, temperature, humidity, and pressure.

models/: Directory where trained models are stored.

source/analyze_weather.py: Script to perform data analysis and generate visualizations.

source/train_model.py: Script to train machine learning models using the processed weather data.

temperature_distribution.png: A plot showing the temperature distribution.

Data Preprocessing

Handling Missing Values: The script checks for missing values in the data and uses strategies like dropping rows with missing data or filling with the mean of the respective column.

Handling Infinite Values: Any infinite values in the dataset are identified and removed to avoid computational issues.

Feature Engineering: Additional features like hour, day, month, day_of_week, and year are extracted from the timestamp to add more predictive power to the model.

Normalization: Features like humidity and pressure are normalized using MinMaxScaler to scale them between 0 and 1, ensuring that no feature disproportionately influences the model.

Analysis and Visualization

The analyze_weather.py script performs the following tasks:

Basic statistics: Mean, standard deviation, and range of features like temperature, humidity, and pressure are calculated.

City-wise analysis: Aggregates the data by city and calculates statistics like mean, min, max for temperature and humidity.

Missing values check: Displays any missing values for each city.

Visualization:

Histograms and KDE plots are generated to visualize the distribution of temperature and humidity.

A scatter plot between temperature and humidity is displayed to analyze their relationship.

Machine Learning Model

Feature Selection: The features used for training are humidity, hour, day, month, and pressure.

Target Variable: The target variable for the models is temperature.

Models Used:

XGBoost Regressor: A gradient boosting model that works well for regression tasks.

Random Forest Regressor: A powerful ensemble method based on multiple decision trees.

Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated based on the R² score, a metric that indicates how well the model explains the variance of the target variable. The higher the R² score, the better the model.

Model Saving

XGBoost Model: Saved as a .json file to retain the model structure.

Random Forest Model: Saved as a .pkl file using joblib, which efficiently stores large Python objects.

Git Large File Storage

Since model files like .dll required by XGBoost exceed GitHub's 100MB file size limit, Git LFS is used to track and store these large files.
