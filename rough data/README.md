# Weather Analysis Project

This project is designed to analyze weather data and predict temperatures using machine learning models. The goal is to process, clean, and analyze weather data to extract meaningful insights, followed by building and training machine learning models such as XGBoost and Random Forest to predict temperature based on various weather features.

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive weather analysis application that performs data cleaning, feature extraction, and training of machine learning models to predict temperature. The dataset contains weather-related information like temperature, humidity, pressure, and timestamp for different cities.

The project utilizes XGBoost and Random Forest Regressors to predict the temperature based on the weather features. It also includes detailed data analysis and visualizations to explore temperature and humidity distributions.

## Features

- **Weather Data Analysis**: 
  - Detects missing values and handles them appropriately.
  - Identifies and removes infinite or very large values in the dataset.
  - Performs city-wise analysis of temperature and humidity statistics.
  
- **Visualizations**:
  - Displays histograms and kernel density estimates (KDE) plots for temperature and humidity distributions.
  
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Trains XGBoost and Random Forest models to predict temperature.
  - Uses MinMax Scaling to normalize features such as humidity and pressure.
  
- **Model Saving**:
  - Trains and saves the models (XGBoost as `.json` and Random Forest as `.pkl`) for later use.
  
- **Git Large File Storage (LFS)**:
  - Manages large model files that exceed GitHub’s file size limit using Git LFS.

## Requirements

The following libraries and tools are required to run the project:

### Python Libraries

- `pandas` - Data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy` - Scientific computing and handling of numerical data.
- `xgboost` - Gradient boosting algorithm for regression.
- `scikit-learn` - Machine learning library for models, preprocessing, and metrics.
- `joblib` - Serialization for saving and loading models.
- `matplotlib` - Data visualization library.
- `seaborn` - Statistical data visualization library.

You can install all the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Git Large File Storage (LFS)

Git LFS is required to handle large files that exceed the file size limits of GitHub (such as `.dll` files). To install Git LFS:

1. Follow the instructions to install Git LFS from [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
2. Initialize Git LFS in your project by running:

```bash
git lfs install
```

### Additional Setup for Windows Users

- Install `Visual Studio Build Tools` for compiling the C++ libraries required by XGBoost.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2atharva21/weather-analysis-project_1.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

```bash
cd weather-analysis-project
```

3. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:

```bash
python -m venv new_venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
  
  ```bash
  new_venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

4. **Install the required dependencies**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```

- `data/weather_data.csv`: Contains weather data with columns like `timestamp`, `city`, `temperature`, `humidity`, and `pressure`.
- `models/`: Stores the trained models after training.
- `source/analyze_weather.py`: Performs data analysis and generates visualizations for weather data.
- `source/train_model.py`: Script to train machine learning models using the processed weather data.
- `temperature_distribution.png`: Image showing the temperature distribution.

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing data is identified and handled by dropping rows with `NaN` values.
2. **Handling Infinite Values**: The script checks for and removes any infinite values that may disrupt model training.
3. **Feature Engineering**: New features such as `hour`, `day`, `month`, `day_of_week`, and `year` are extracted from the timestamp column to enhance model performance.
4. **Normalization**: Features like humidity and pressure are normalized using the MinMaxScaler to scale values between 0 and 1.

## Analysis and Visualization

The `analyze_weather.py` script performs the following analyses:

- **Basic statistics** on the weather data such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for each feature.
- **City-wise analysis** of temperature and humidity using aggregation functions (`mean`, `std`, `min`, `max`).
- **Missing values check** to identify cities with missing data.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Histograms and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots for temperature and humidity distributions.

## Machine Learning Model

1. **Feature Selection**: The features selected for model training are `humidity`, `hour`, `day`, `month`, and `pressure`.
2. **Target Variable**: The target variable for prediction is `temperature`.
3. **Models Used**:
   - **XGBoost Regressor**: A gradient boosting model that works well for regression tasks.
   - **Random Forest Regressor**: An ensemble of decision trees for regression tasks.

## Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated using the **R² score**, which indicates how well the model predicts the target variable. The R² score is calculated on the entire dataset using the predicted temperature values.

## Model Saving

Once the models are trained, they are saved to disk:

- **XGBoost Model**: Saved in `.json` format.
- **Random Forest Model**: Saved in `.pkl` format using `joblib`.

These models can be loaded and used for future predictions without retraining.

## Git Large File Storage

The `.dll` file required by XGBoost exceeds GitHub’s file size limit of 100MB. To handle this, Git Large File Storage (LFS) is used to track and store large files.

**To set up Git LFS**:
1. Install Git LFS by following the instructions on [Git LFS website](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
2. Initialize LFS in your local repository:

```bash
git lfs install
```

3. Track the large `.dll` files:

```bash
git lfs track "*.dll"
```

## Usage

1. **Run the weather data analysis**:

```bash
python source/analyze_weather.py
```

2. **Train the machine learning models**:

```bash
python source/train_model.py
```

3. **Use the trained models**:
   - The trained models are saved in the `models/` folder.
   - You can load and use these models to make predictions on new weather data.
